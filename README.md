- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrostMando
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, AI text adventures and Space Station 14. I use Linux as my main OS and VS Code as my IDE.
- 🌱 I’m currently setting up the environment to work on Space Station 14, a remake of the cult classic Space Station 13.
- 💞️ I’m dedicated to collaborate on Space Station 14. I hope that in the near future I will be a good asset to the SS14 dev team :)
